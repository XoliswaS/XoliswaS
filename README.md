🚀 
Aspiring Cloud & DevOps Engineer | AWS Re/Start Student | Tech Enthusiast


I’m currently studying AWS Re/Start Cloud Practitioner, where I’m learning the foundations of cloud computing, Linux, networking, security, and more.

I’m also very interested in AI, automation, and modern DevOps tools.



I’m working hard toward becoming a Cloud Engineer or DevOps Engineer because I enjoy solving problems, building efficient systems, and understanding how technology works behind the scenes.
